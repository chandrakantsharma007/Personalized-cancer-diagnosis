# Personalized-cancer-dignosis

When a doctor suspects a cancer in a patient, probably the first thing he does is to collect the tumor sample from the patient. He then puts the sample through genetic sequencing of DNA. A tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. Here briefly, a ‘mutation’ is a small change in gene which causes cancer. One more important thing is that for every gene, there is a variation associated with it. The process for cancer diagnosis may be briefed as follows:

A molecular pathologist selects a list of genetic variations of interest.
He searches for evidence in the medical literature that somehow are relevant to the genetic variations of interest.
Finally the molecular pathologist spends a huge amount of time analyzing the evidence related to each of the variations to classify them.

The goal of our project is to replace step 3 by a machine learning model. The molecular pathologist will still have to decide which variations are of interest, and also collect the relevant evidence for them. But the last step, which is also the most time consuming, will be fully automated. So, let us learn how to apply the multi-class classification technique of machine learning to aid the doctor in his analysis of the cancer patient.
